GPIO 6 is the ground pin.
I'll be using GPIO 8, 10 and 12 for the connections to the red, yellow and green LED's, respectively.
Using 220 Ohm resistors.

Items: Raspberry Pi 400, Breadboard, red yellow green LED's, 220 Ohm resistors, Male-to-female jumper wires.

Transferred python code to my Google Keep, which I used in my Pi, which I copypasted into my terminal.
Used PubNub to facilitate control from my laptop to the Pi.
Created a templates directory where i put index.html

http link:
pi: http://127.0.1.1:5000
laptop: http://192.168.1.10:5000

aws public ipv4 address: 54.246.150.46

was gonna use (chmod 400 "C:\Users\alaze\Downloads\Repeat Projects\IOT Development\RepeatProject\.ssh\repeat_key_pair_3.pem")

terminal notes:
cd C:\Users\alaze\Downloads\Repeat Projects\IOT Development\RepeatProject\.ssh
scp -i repeat_key_pair_3.pem "..\pi code\web_controller.py" ubuntu@54.246.150.46:/home/ubuntu/

--- first time only ---
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip nginx
pip3 install flask pubnub gunicorn

--- continue ---
ssh -i repeat_key_pair_3.pem ubuntu@54.246.150.46
gunicorn -w 1 web_controller:app --bind 127.0.1.1:5000 --daemon
ps aux | grep gunicorn
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/trafficlight

-- extra notes --

my pi 400 has a local ip from my router, which works for devices on the same network.
when i run flask with host='0.0.0.0', it makes the site reachable through my local ip and port 5000.
i can only use my public ip for outside access if i set up port forwarding on my router.
unfortunately i can't secure my app since i don't know how to + it's complicated.
